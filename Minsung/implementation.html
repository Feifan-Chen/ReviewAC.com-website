  <h1>Rationale for version choices</h1>
  <h2>Information/tutorials used</h2>
  <p>
  I've mostly referred to the materials on the website 
  <a href=https://www.w3schools.com>w3schools.com</a>
  in order to create these webpages.
  I knew from a bit of experience that this website
  has a lot of beginner-friendly tutorials on how to
  use html to create one's own webpages.
  After a bit of google search in order to cross-reference
  other websites with similar content, I've decided that
  this website was good enough to use for my intentions.
  </p>
  <p>
  Information on using PHP were also mostly taken from w3schools, but 
  some bits of code were taken from stack overflow. These are marked
  in the .php files via comments.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition, informatoin on using mySQL were taken exclusively from w3schools.
  I did look at other souces for advice, but no other sources were helpful enough
  at my level of knowledge to utilize enough in my implementations.
  </p>
  <h2>Editors used</h2>
  <p>I've mainly used nano on the pi, and gedit on university computer systems.</p>
  <h2>HTML version used</h2>
  <p>
  HTML5 was used to create these webpages, since it's the latest html version
  and comes with a lot of functionalities that I can use later down the line
  when I wish to add additional media onto my homepage.
  </p>
  <h2>CSS version used</h2>
  <p>
  CSS level 3 was used, as it is the most recent version of CSS since 1999.
  </p>
  <h2>Validators used</h2>
  <p>
  Both html and css were validated via the validator website provided by w3.
  </p>
  <h2>OS used</h2>
  <p>The webpage was created on a linux environment.</p>
  <h2>Browser used</h2>
  <p>Mozilla Firefox was the browser of choice in testing the browser.</p>
  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <p>
  Each sections have been divided using the heading(<\h2> tags)
  in order to make each body of text clearly separated. In addition,
  links to each page is given with explanation around it, thus making clear
  what the purpose of the link is. When images will be added later on,
  all images will have an alternative text explaining what the picture is about
  for visually-impaired users.
  </p>
  <h2>PHP version used</h2>
  <p>PHP 7 was used for any webpages using php syntax.</p>
  <h2>Database system used</h2>
  <p>The phpmyadmin system provided by the school was used in 
  implementing databases in websites.</p>
