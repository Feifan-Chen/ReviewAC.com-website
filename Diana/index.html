    <h3>Dalmatian Dog</h3>

    <p>The Dalmatian is a breed of medium-sized dog, noted for its unique black or liver spotted coat and 
    mainly used as a carriage dog in its early days. Its roots trace back to Croatia and its historical 
    region of Dalmatia.</p> 
    <p>Today, it is a popular family pet and many dog enthusiasts enter Dalmatians into kennel
     club competitions. </p>



    <h3 id="body">Body</h3>
    <p>The Dalmatian is a medium sized, well-defined, muscular dog with excellent endurance and stamina. 
    When fully grown, according to the American Kennel Club breed standard, it stands from 19 to 23 
    inches (48 to 58 cm) tall, with males usually slightly larger than females.</p>
    <p>Both the AKC and The Kennel Club in the UK allows height up to 24 inches (61 cm) but that 
    isn't ideal. The outline of the dog should be square when viewed from the side: The body is as long 
    from forechest to buttocks as it is tall at the withers, and the shoulders are well-laid back, the 
    stifle is well-bent and the hocks are well-let down. The Dalmatian's feet are round with well-arched
     toes, and the nails are usually white or the same colour as the dog's spots. </p>
    <p>The thin ears taper towards the tip and are set fairly high and close to the head. Eye color 
    varies between brown, amber, or blue, with some dogs having one blue eye and one brown eye, or other combinations.</p>


    <h3 id="coat">Coat</h3>
    <p>Dalmatian puppies are born with plain white coats and their first spots usually appear within 3 
     to 4 weeks after birth, however spots are visible on their skin. After about a month, they have most
     of their spots, although they continue to develop throughout life at a much slower rate. Spots 
     usually range in size from 30 to 60 mm, and are most commonly black or brown (liver) on a white 
     background.</p>
   <p> Other, more rare colors, include:
   <ol>
   <li>blue (a blue-grayish color)
   <li>brindle
   <li>mosaic
   <li>orange
   <li>lemon (dark to pale yellow)
   </ol>
  
    <p> Patches of color may appear anywhere on the body, mostly on the head or ears, and usually, consist 
    of a solid color. Patches are visible at birth and are not a group of connected spots and are 
    identifiable by the smooth edge of the patch. The Dalmatian coat is usually short, fine, and dense; 
    however, smooth-coated Dalmatians occasionally produce long-coated offspring. Long-coated Dalmatians 
    are not acceptable in the breed standard, however, these individuals experience much less shedding than
     their smooth-coated counterparts, which shed considerably year-round.</p>


    <h3 id="health"> Health </h3>
    <p>Dalmatians are a relatively healthy and easy to keep breed. Like other breeds, Dalmatians display 
    a propensity towards certain health problems specific to their breed, such as deafness, allergies and 
    urinary stones.</p>
